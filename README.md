This module is a simple Joomla implementation of <a href="https://github.com/jssor">Jssor Slider</a>.

Only the 'Slider with Slideshow (jQuery)' option has been implemented but the module can be extended to cater for other option combinations.

Some features require my 'extension for sigplus Image Gallery' content plugin, which if needed must also be installed and enabled.

Only a small subset of Jssor Slider is included in this project.
